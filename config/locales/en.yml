# Begin site-specific text.
# 1) Do not use tabs, only spaces!
# 2) All text should be in UTF8 (be sure your text editor uses that encoding)
# 3) format is: LABEL: text. 
# If you need to include a ' in the text, use this format: 
#    LABEL: "text's got an apostrophe..." (double quotes around string)
# If you need to include a " in the text, use this format: 
#    LABEL: "text has \"a quote\" inside" (double quotes and backslash for embedded quotes)
# Or if you want some leading/trailing whitespace in the text, use this format
#    LABEL: " some text that begins with some whitespace and/or ends with some whitespace "
# Otherwise, no need for quotes around text.

        summary: "Everyday Lio, back from school, opened the tap and drank water with cupped hands.<br />
        Everyday Molengue went to get water from the river, but before leaving he drank a handful of water, dipping his hand where the current was stronger.<br />
        Everyday Luise pulled the bucket up from the well and poured water into the clay amphora. But before leaving she drank three or four times by dipping her cupped hands into the bucket and putting them to her lips.<br />
<br />
        One day Lio, coming home, opened the tap and a stream of water  that left red dust came out and tasted of salt. \"There is water in the bottle in the fridge\", said the mother.<br />
        One day Molengue went down to the river and saw hundreds of fish flat on their back. He took a bit of water in his hand and noticed a smell of gasoline.<br />
        Behind him a man in uniform with a big smile handed him a plastic bag full of water with writing that said: This is a charitable gift.<br />
        One day Luise saw that there were people around the well talking animatedly. No bird was bathing in the water spilling from the buckets and a sign with a skull hung from a rope. All said that a cesspool had killed the well.<br />
        But a rich and friendly people had sent a tanker with water that comes from afar, but people can drink water only after boiling it. Wait every day and just get in line and say thanks.<br />
<br />
        Lio, Molengue and Luise went to sleep restless thinking that now their water had a master and dreamed.<br />
<br />
        Lio dreamed that a huge drop fell in the ocean and made a drop stretch reaching up to the sky like a tap with the rod upward.<br />
        Molengue dreamed that millions of huge drops of good water fell from the sky, like a river that came down from heaven.<br />
        Luise dreamed that the droplets fell to the ground creating millions of wells, clear and fresh.<br />
        All three dreamed of taking water in cupped hands and drinking it in great gulps while smiling.<br />
        And all the world people placed cupped hands into the water they want to nurture and protect.<br />
        And all three of their mothers thought it would be good and right if for every drop that falls free there was a free drop that returns.<br />
<br />
        Save Dripplets. Become Water Hunters!<br />
        Save the dripdrops, become a waterhunter!<br />
